# vanilla-extract-tutorial

Hello! This is an example for my tutorial on vanilla-extract. The goal is to show off all the cool features of vanilla-extract while building a real-world example. In this instance you'll be rebuilding a stats component as shown on [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/data-display/stats#component-72704cac437a06d94cdb941c274591ba).

![Stats component with shared borders. Displaying for the last 30 days the total subscribers, average open rate, and average click rate.](https://tailwindui.com/img/components/stats.03-with-shared-borders-xl.png)
